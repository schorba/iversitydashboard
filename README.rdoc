MOOCs (Massive Online  Open  Courses)  on  "Iversuty"  platform. This  dashboard is based on  the  courses
starting and finishing dates and should help the user to get an overview of:

*  How coursesâ€™ runtimes are distributed over time
*  How many and which courses are going to start soon.
*  How many and which courses are going to finish soon.
